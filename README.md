# over-engineered-hello-world-mvc
Example for an over engineered model view controller in python

The user can input a message, which the application encrypts using a Caesar's cipher the message "Hello Username" with a random shift.
The encrypted message is then passed to the view component, which displays it in the console.
The shift value for Caesar's cipher can be adjusted in the controller component by having the user input a number.
In case the user guesses the correct shift value, the application will congratulate the user.
