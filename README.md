# over-engineered-hello-world-mvc
Example for an over engineered model view controller in python

The application uses Caesar's cipher to encrypt the message "Hello World" with a predetermined shift.
The encrypted message is then passed to the view component, which displays it in the console.
The shift value for Caesar's cipher can be adjusted in the controller component.
